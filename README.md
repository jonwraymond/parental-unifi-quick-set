# Parental Unifi Quick Set

A simple web-based tool for quickly setting up parental controls on UniFi networks. Block apps like Fortnite, Roblox, or YouTube with flexible scheduling options.

## Features

- **Easy Login**: Connect to your UniFi controller with your credentials
- **App Blocking**: Block popular apps and games by name
- **Flexible Scheduling**:
  - Permanent blocks
  - Temporary blocks (for X hours)
  - Block until a specific time
  - Recurring schedules (e.g., block gaming apps on school nights)
- **Device Selection**: Choose which devices to apply rules to
- **Network Selection**: Apply rules to specific VLANs or networks

## Prerequisites

- UniFi Dream Machine or UniFi Controller
- Rust (for building from source)
- Docker (for containerized deployment)

## Configuration

Before running, update the UniFi controller URL in `src/main.rs` to match your setup.

### ðŸ”§ **UniFi Setup Required**

**ðŸ‘‰ [Complete UniFi Setup Guide](docs/UNIFI_SETUP_GUIDE.md) ðŸ‘ˆ**

This application requires a **local admin account** on your UniFi controller. Follow our comprehensive guide to:
- âœ… Create a local admin account with proper permissions
- âœ… Enable API access (usually enabled by default)
- âœ… Test the configuration end-to-end
- âœ… Implement security best practices

**Quick Summary:**
1. **Create local admin**: Settings â†’ System â†’ Administration â†’ Add New Admin
2. **Use "Site Administrator" role** (NOT "View Only")
3. **Disable "Remote Access"** for security
4. **Test API access** at `https://[controller-ip]:8443/api/self`

See **[Authentication Options Guide](docs/AUTHENTICATION_OPTIONS.md)** for detailed explanation of why local admin accounts are required.

## Building

### Local Development

```bash
cargo build --release
cargo run
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`

### Docker

```bash
docker build -t parental-unifi-quick-set .
docker run -p 3000:3000 parental-unifi-quick-set
```

## Deployment Options

### 1. Docker Compose (Recommended)

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

### 2. Fly.io

```bash
fly launch
fly deploy
```

### 3. Systemd Service (Linux)

Copy the binary and create a systemd service file.

## Development Workflow

This project uses frequent, small commits for easy rollback and better version control.

### Quick Start:
```bash
# Install git hooks (one-time setup)
./scripts/install-hooks.sh

# For frequent commits, use the quick commit script
./scripts/quick-commit.sh

# Or specify a message directly
./scripts/quick-commit.sh "feat: Add new feature description"
```

### Best Practices:
- **Commit early, commit often** - Small commits are easier to review and rollback
- **One logical change per commit** - Each commit should represent a single improvement
- **Use descriptive messages** - Follow conventional commit format (feat:, fix:, docs:, etc.)

See [COMMIT_GUIDELINES.md](COMMIT_GUIDELINES.md) for detailed guidelines and examples.

## Usage

1. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` (or your deployed URL)
2. Login with your UniFi credentials
3. Select apps to block
4. Choose blocking schedule
5. Select target networks and devices
6. Create the rule

## Security Notes

- The app accepts self-signed certificates from UniFi controllers
- Credentials are not stored - authentication tokens are kept in memory only
- Consider using HTTPS in production
