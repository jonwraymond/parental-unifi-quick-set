# UniFi Authentication Options for Parental Control App

## Current Implementation: Local Admin (Recommended)

Our app currently uses **local admin accounts** which is the **recommended approach** for UniFi API integrations as of 2024.

### Why Local Admin Accounts?

1. **No MFA Required**: Unlike cloud accounts, local accounts don't require Multi-Factor Authentication
2. **Reliable API Access**: Designed for programmatic access
3. **Dedicated Service Accounts**: Best practice for application integrations
4. **Full Network Control**: Access to all traffic rule APIs

## Research: Site Manager API Alternative (Not Suitable)

We investigated using the **UniFi Site Manager API** with SSO authentication as an alternative approach, but found it **unsuitable for parental control applications**:

### ‚ùå **Why Site Manager API Won't Work:**

1. **Read-Only Limitation**: 
   - Current v1.0 API is explicitly read-only
   - Cannot create, update, or delete traffic rules
   - No write capabilities for firewall management

2. **Missing Core Features**:
   - No traffic rule endpoints
   - No device blocking/unblocking capabilities  
   - No parental control management functions
   - Limited to basic device info and metrics

3. **Available Endpoints** (v1.0):
   - List Hosts/Sites/Devices (read-only)
   - ISP Metrics (read-only)
   - SD-WAN Configs (read-only)
   - **No traffic management functionality**

4. **Future Uncertainty**: 
   - Documentation promises write capabilities "when available"
   - No timeline provided for traffic rule management
   - Current application needs immediate functionality

### üìä **API Comparison Summary**

| Capability | Local Network API | Site Manager API |
|------------|------------------|------------------|
| Create Traffic Rules | ‚úÖ Full Support | ‚ùå Not Available |
| Block Applications | ‚úÖ Full Support | ‚ùå Not Available |
| Device Management | ‚úÖ Full Control | ‚ùå Read-Only Info |
| Real-time Changes | ‚úÖ Immediate | ‚ùå No Write Access |
| Works Offline | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚ùå Cloud Dependent |

### Setting Up Local Admin (User Instructions)

1. **Access UniFi Controller** at your local IP (e.g., https://192.168.1.1:8443)
2. **Navigate to**: Settings > System > Administration
3. **Click**: "Add New Admin"
4. **Configure**:
   - ‚úÖ **Disable "Remote Access"** (this makes it local-only)
   - ‚úÖ **Set strong password**
   - ‚úÖ **Choose appropriate permissions** (Site Administrator for full access)
   - ‚úÖ **Document credentials securely**

## Admin Permission Levels Explained

### üîç **"Local" vs "Cloud" (Account Storage)**

**"Local Admin" refers to WHERE the account is stored, not the permission level:**

- **üè† Local Account**: Stored on your UniFi controller (‚úÖ Works with API)
- **‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud Account**: Stored at Ubiquiti (‚ùå Requires MFA, breaks API)

### üìä **Permission Levels for Local Accounts**

You can create local accounts with different permission levels:

| Role | Traffic Rules | Device Control | API Access | Recommended For |
|------|---------------|----------------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Super Administrator** | ‚úÖ Full Access | ‚úÖ Full Access | ‚úÖ Full API | Controller owners only |
| **Site Administrator** | ‚úÖ Full Access | ‚úÖ Full Access | ‚úÖ Full API | **‚úÖ Parental Control Apps** |
| **View Only** | ‚ùå Read Only | ‚ùå Read Only | ‚úÖ Read-Only API | Monitoring/reporting only |
| **Custom Role** | üîß Configurable | üîß Configurable | üîß Variable API | Specific use cases |

### üéØ **Recommended: Site Administrator (Local)**

For parental control applications, **Site Administrator** is the sweet spot:

**‚úÖ What it CAN do:**
- Create and modify traffic rules (needed to block apps)
- Block/unblock client devices  
- Manage network settings
- Full API access for your application
- View all site statistics and logs

**‚ùå What it CANNOT do:**
- Create other administrator accounts (security benefit)
- Access other sites on the controller (if multi-site)
- Modify global controller settings (security benefit)
- Delete the controller or perform system operations

### üîß **Setup for Different Roles**

#### **Site Administrator (Recommended)**
```
Settings > System > Administration > Add New Admin
- Username: parental-control-app
- Role: Site Administrator  
- Site Access: [Your Site Name]
- ‚ùå Remote Access (disable this!)
- ‚úÖ Set Admin Password
```

#### **Custom Role (Advanced Users)**
If you want minimal permissions, you can create a custom role with only:
- ‚úÖ Firewall Rules (manage traffic rules)
- ‚úÖ Client Management (block/unblock devices)  
- ‚ùå Everything else (disabled)

#### **View Only (Not Suitable)**
This won't work for parental controls because it cannot:
- ‚ùå Create traffic rules
- ‚ùå Block applications
- ‚ùå Modify device settings

### Best Practices

1. **Dedicated Service Account**: Create a specific admin account just for this application
2. **Strong Password**: Use a complex, unique password
3. **Minimal Permissions**: Grant only necessary access levels
4. **Regular Rotation**: Change passwords periodically
5. **Monitor Usage**: Review admin activity logs regularly

## Alternative Authentication Methods (Not Recommended)

### ‚ùå **UniFi Cloud Accounts (Problems)**
- **MFA Requirement**: Since July 2024, all cloud accounts require Multi-Factor Authentication
- **API Incompatibility**: MFA breaks programmatic API access
- **Internet Dependency**: Requires connection to Ubiquiti cloud services
- **Complexity**: OAuth flows add unnecessary complexity

### ‚ùå **Site Manager API (Current Limitations)**
- **Read-Only Access**: Cannot modify traffic rules or device settings
- **Missing Features**: No parental control or traffic management capabilities
- **Future Dependency**: Write access promised but not available
- **Cloud Dependency**: Requires internet connection and Ubiquiti account

## Conclusion

**Local admin accounts remain the best and only viable option** for UniFi parental control applications. The Site Manager API, while offering SSO integration, lacks the fundamental write capabilities needed for traffic rule management and device control.

Our current implementation following local admin best practices provides:
- ‚úÖ Full functionality access
- ‚úÖ Reliable, offline operation  
- ‚úÖ Immediate real-time control
- ‚úÖ Industry-standard security practices
- ‚úÖ No external dependencies
